# canvas

**A simple framework to work with canvas easier - made with webpack**

since coding in js for canvas needs much more coding than normal projects,
i decide to create a little framework for managing codes better

in this little framework, i use webpack as build tool also some common functionalities added to make things easier

##### How to use it?

just clone the repo and then open the project on Command prompt then run

`
  npm install
`

after that you can start a server using 

`
npm run start
`

this one uses hot reload , so you don't need to refresh each time

have good times!
